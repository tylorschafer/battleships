# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Learning Goals: both participants full understand and learn the projected concepts and technical information.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
We both agree that both approaches are important depending on our personal requirements for the programming time. Meaning some days we will be able to meet and pair program liteally together while other days working remotely or with a divide and conquer approach is necessary.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Corina: I communicate best directly and with as much data and information as possible. From the data, we can discuss how to approach the project and where to go from there. I prefer to have a big picture understanding to conceptualize the importance of each individual task or feature.
Tylor: Direct feedback, no hostility. Conceptualization first is best as well. When communication problems, concrete examples whenever possible is prefered. Slack messages whenever is fine.
* How would you describe your work style?
Tylor: Hybrid: once in a while collaborating together is important but I also get a lot of good work done independently.
Corina: Independent is often how I prefer to work although I do need and want input occasionally.
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Both good at working independently makes it easier to agree to divide and conquer. Also, we both had Lover of Moderation and Objective Analytical as our top Pairin characteristics therefore we both approach the problem in a very similar fashion.
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
In our first independent project, Tylor found a few times where he definitely needed some outside input to get through the tough spot he hit.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
We've decided to conceptualize first, then create an outline or blueprint for the project and decide who's going to work on what. From there, we both know our tasks and roles.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
Bringing the obstacle to the other partner to see if we can overcome together then request additional outside help as needed.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
We both agree that coming to meet on campus as often as possible will be beneficial.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Corina: I have outside meetings as a personal requirement that are important. I've expressed this and will continue to communicate with Tylor when I have them and how they will impact our project worktime.
Tylor: I prefer to be home by 7pm and done coding for the day by around 9pm.
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Tylor: I like to give positive reinforcement due my my management experience.
Corina: I feel like people can't change what they don't know so I always like to bring awareness first and then go from there. I also try to be solution oriented.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Tylor: I feel pretty strong in building methods and I feel shaky in TDD.
Corina: I feel I am strong in TTD and I need to pay more attention to testing fringe cases and opposite variations.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Using our calendars to actually book scheduled time to work on the project. Respecting each others time. Using Slack to communicate and do remote pairing.
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
When there are problems with our individual features or work, they should be brought to the team to be discussed and worked through togther.
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Our project will be considered successful to us when we've completed all 4 iterations and have reached 4's on each category in the rubric.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
After finishing a bug chunk or feature, treat the partner to coffee or lunch or something to get out of the basement and celebrate the achievement.

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Corina Allen & Tylor Schafer

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): As a team, we want to ensure both members have a full understanding of the concepts and technical skills of this project. As the overachievers we both identify as, we will feel successful when we've completed up to Iteration 3 and put our solid effort into completing as much as possible on Iteration 4. We also are going to strive for a 4 in each category on the graded rubric.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Both of us had Objective Analytical and Lover of Moderation as our top Pairin qualities meaning we both have a similar approach. We've agreed that Divide-and-Conquer will be used often with some paired programming done when we can come together on campus to work.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: Corina is solution oriented and Tylor prefers positive reinforcement so together we should be able to overcome obstacles fairly easily with our analytical approaches and optimistic attitudes.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): We both have plans on Thursday the 4th of July so we plan on coming together on campus Friday and over the weekend. Corina has expressed her personal outside Turing meetings she attends and will keep Tylor updated on when she isn't available.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): We are both very accessable via slack and have exchanged phone numbers for immediate issues. When unavailable, we both are ok with leaving messages for one another in Slack DM's and responded when available.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Tylor feels solid in method definitions and is shaky with TDD while Corina is confidant in TDD but wants to strengthen her testing of fringe cases and negative variations.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Ship Class will be Corina and Cells Class will be Tylor to start.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): No one merges their own code. We will submit a Pull Request when ready to Merge in our Branch. The partner will review the code and then merge when ready. Because the Ship and Cells interact, once we are half way through with each of our classes, we will submit PR so the other can work on their code with access to the class. When Merge Conflict, we will either pair program in person or via a Slack call to discuss what to keep and what can be removed.  

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Again, Corina is solution oriented while Tylor brings positive reinforcements. We both expect issues and feedback to be brought to the table as soon as possible for resolution.

Project management tools we will use: Google Calendar

Day 1 Agenda: Both will thoroughly read Iterations and Rubric. Day 1 will be conceptualizing the project and creating our outline and blueprint for features, how to approach different aspects of the project and setting up deadlines and our project schedule.
